## Phase 6: `match` instead of `if` chain

**Scope:** `src/lib.rs`

Replaced the `if mode == ReadMode::All { ... } else if mode == ReadMode::Errors { ... } else if mode == ReadMode::Exchanges { ... } else { panic!(...) }` chain in `read_log()` with an exhaustive `match &mode` expression containing three explicit arms and no wildcard/default arm. This makes the filtering logic idiomatic Rust and enables compiler-verified exhaustiveness. The `panic!("unknown mode {:?}", mode)` arm and both hint comments (`// подсказка: лучше match` and `// подсказка: паниковать в библиотечном коде - нехорошо`) were removed as a natural consequence of the exhaustive match. Added two new tests (`test_errors_mode` and `test_exchanges_mode`) to exercise the `ReadMode::Errors` and `ReadMode::Exchanges` filter paths. All existing tests pass unchanged; no behavior changes.

## Phase 5: `u8` constants -> `enum ReadMode`

**Scope:** `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`

Replaced the three public `u8` mode constants (`READ_MODE_ALL`, `READ_MODE_ERRORS`, `READ_MODE_EXCHANGES`) with a public `enum ReadMode` having variants `All`, `Errors`, and `Exchanges`, deriving `Debug` and `PartialEq`. Updated the `read_log()` function signature from `mode: u8` to `mode: ReadMode`, replaced all constant references in the filtering logic with enum variants, updated the `panic!` format string to use `{:?}`, and adapted call sites in `main.rs` and the test module. Removed the hint comment `// подсказка: лучше использовать enum и match`. Invalid mode values are now caught at compile time instead of causing a runtime panic. All existing tests pass unchanged; no behavior changes.

## Phase 4: Generic `R: Read` instead of trait object

**Scope:** `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`

Replaced `Box<dyn MyReader>` with a generic type parameter `R: Read` on `LogIterator`, enabling static dispatch and monomorphization. Removed the `MyReader` supertrait (the E0225 workaround), its blanket impl, the associated comments, and the hint comment. The `read_log()` public API now accepts `impl Read` instead of `Box<dyn MyReader>`, allowing callers to pass any reader directly without boxing. Removed `#[derive(Debug)]` from the private `LogIterator` struct to avoid an unnecessary `R: Debug` bound. All existing tests pass unchanged; no behavior changes.

## Phase 3: Remove `unsafe` transmute

**Scope:** Verification only (no source code changes)

Formally verified that the `unsafe { transmute(...) }` block in `LogIterator::new()` was fully removed as a side-effect of Phase 2. Confirmed zero occurrences of `unsafe` and `transmute` across all source files, confirmed the associated hint comment (`// подсказка: unsafe избыточен, да и весь rc - тоже`) was already removed, and validated that all 16 tests pass and CLI output is unchanged. No Rust source code was modified in this phase.

## Phase 2: Remove `Rc<RefCell>`

**Scope:** `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`

Removed the unnecessary `Rc<RefCell<Box<dyn MyReader>>>` wrapping from `LogIterator`, giving it direct ownership of the reader via `Box<dyn MyReader>`. This eliminated the `RefMutWrapper` adapter struct, the `unsafe { transmute }` lifetime extension, and the self-referential struct pattern. The `read_log()` API now accepts `Box<dyn MyReader>` instead of `Rc<RefCell<Box<dyn MyReader>>>`. No behavior changes; all existing tests pass unchanged.

## Phase 1: `String` -> `&str` in `Parser` trait

**Scope:** `src/parse.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`

Migrated the `Parser` trait and all combinator implementations from operating on owned `String` values to borrowed `&str` slices with lifetimes. This reduces unnecessary heap allocations throughout the parsing pipeline. Updated all 15 tests in `parse.rs` and adapted call sites in `lib.rs` and `main.rs`.
